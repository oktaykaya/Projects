# Interpolation Methods

This project demonstrates different interpolation methods to estimate the values of a function at given points using Python. The methods implemented include:

1. Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation
2. Lagrange Interpolation
3. Direct Method Interpolation

## Overview

Interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points. This project uses three different methods to interpolate and plot the data points.

## Data

The data used for interpolation is:

```python
x = [20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28]
y = [18, 17, 15, 14, 16, 15]
