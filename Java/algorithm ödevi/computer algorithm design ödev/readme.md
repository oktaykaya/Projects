# Pyramid Pattern Printing in Java

This repository contains two Java classes that demonstrate how to print a pyramid pattern of stars using both iterative and recursive methods.

## Classes

1. **iteratorPyramid**: Uses an iterative approach to print the pyramid pattern.
2. **pyramid**: Uses a recursive approach to print the pyramid pattern.

## iteratorPyramid Class

### Description

The `iteratorPyramid` class uses a nested loop structure to print a pyramid pattern of stars.

### Method

- **`static void IterativePrintPyramid(int height)`**: 
  - Prints a pyramid pattern with a specified height.
  - Uses nested loops to control the number of spaces and stars on each line.
  - `height` parameter specifies the number of lines in the pyramid.
